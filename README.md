# Stroke_Risk_Prediction
 This project focuses on creating a predictive model to assess the likelihood of heart disease in patients using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.<br> The dataset contains various medical attributes, which will be analyzed to predict whether a patient has heart disease.
<br><br>

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a popular source for machine learning datasets.<br>
It includes various medical attributes, such as age,sexchest pain,resting blood pressure,cholestrol,
fasting blood sugar etc
<br><br>

## Tools and Libraries
Python and Jupyter Notebook will be used as the primary development environment, offering flexibility for writing code and analyzing results interactively.<br>
The following libraries will be employed:<br>
-Numpy: For numerical operations and efficient array manipulations.  
-Pandas: For handling and manipulating tabular data, allowing easy exploration and transformation of the dataset.  
-sklearn.model_selection: Specifically, the train_test_split function will be used to divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

## Logistic regression
The project will utilize Logistic Regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks like this one, where the goal is to predict whether heart disease is present or absent.<br>
Logistic regression is ideal for this project because it provides probability-based predictions and works well with medical datasets where the outcomes are binary i.e <br> 1 =>presence of diesease,0 => absence of disease.<br>
